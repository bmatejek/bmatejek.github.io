<div class="home-biography">
    Hello, I am Brian Matejek. I am a research scientist at SRI International in the <a href="https://nusci.csl.sri.com" target="_blank">Neuro-Symbolic Computing and Intelligence Research Group</a> of the Computer Science Laboratory. I am interested in robust artificial intelligence, machine learning, low-energy computation, and compression. Some of my recent work has focused on creating high assurance machine learning solutions in healthcare and cybersecurity settings (TMLR 2025, ISBI 2025, ISBI 2024), as well as energy-constrained algorithms and artificial intelligence (NeurIPS 2025). I received my Ph.D. from Harvard University, working under the guidance of Hanspeter Pfister in the <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Visual Computing Group</a>. My doctoral research concerned biologically-aware algorithms for connectomics, the interdisciplinary field between computer science and neuroscience. Specifically, I focused on the compression, error correction, and volume processing of the terabyte label volumes and graph analysis on the neuronal wiring diagrams. Before that, I completed my master's and bachelor's degrees at Princeton University working closely with Thomas Funkhouser.
